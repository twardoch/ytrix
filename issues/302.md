Implement CLI commands 'plists2info' and 'plist2info'. Their inputs will be like of 'plists2mlist' and of 'plist2mlist'. The output will be a folder (specified or autodefined). The output folder will contain subfolders named after the title of the playlist. Each subfolder will contain: 

- one or more VIDEO.LANG.md and one or more VIDEO.LANG.srt files for each VIDEO, where VIDEO is the title of the video prefixed by a zero-padded sequential number corresponding to the position of the video in the playlist.
- playlist.yaml containing general info, and info about each video in the playlist (use the VIDEO names as keys).

Each VIDEO.LANG.srt (where LANG is the iso lang code) contains the subtitles for the video in the corresponding language. We get as many as possible. 

Each VIDEO.LANG.md starts with a YAML metadata block about the video, detailing the video's title, description, duration, and all other possible metadata. Then we have the Markdown which should be the transcription of the video in the corresponding language, based on the subtitles. but with the timestamps removed. 

1. Use the @./external/yt-dlp/ package programmatically. 
2. Research the best packages to handle the other tasks.  
3. Make the whole task work within the @./ytrix/ code using all its goodies. 
4. Test with 'plists2info' with @./example/playlists-yff.txt
